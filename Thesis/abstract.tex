\section{Abstract}
This thesis explores the feasibility of using optimization algorithms to facilitate barter as a market mechanism. A dynamic scale free graph models the variability of tasks, and a uniform acceptance probability $p$ models the likelihood users will be satisfied with suggested exchanges. The ideal exchange size depends on $p$. This thesis tests an optimal polynomial time algorithm (for $p=1$), a greedy shortest cycle algorithm, a dynamic matching algorithm, and a two-way matching algorithm. In addition, there is a stigmergic approach to using the optimal algorithm with $p < 1$, where when a user rejects a match the surrounding users are kept in hold as another match is sought. The greedy shortest cycle algorithm performs almost as well as the optimal algorithm, and far better when $p < 1$. Good news for whoever wants to do the rest of the work to get a large-scale offer network up and running.
