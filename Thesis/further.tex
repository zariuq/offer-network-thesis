\section{Further Work}


If time allows, the impact of a few gifts and their chains will be investigated.

\section{Additional Features}

Below is a list of potentially desirable features of an offer network that don't qualify for an MVP:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reputation biased matching
  \item Preferences for matching based on
    \begin{itemize}
      \item User preferences
      \item Task prefreences
    \end{itemize}\subsection{Additional Features}
