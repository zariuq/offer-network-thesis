{Centralised matching programs have been
established in
several countries to organise kidney
exchanges between
incompatible patient-donor pairs. At the
heart of these
programs are algorithms to solve kidney
exchange problems,
which can be modelled as cycle packing
problems in a
directed graph, involving cycles of length 2,
3, or even
longer. Usually the goal is to maximise the
number of
transplants, but sometimes the total benefit
is maximised by
considering the differences between suitable
kidneys. These
problems correspond to computing cycle
packings of maximum
size or maximum weight in directed graphs.
Here we prove the
APX-completeness of the problem of finding a
maximum size
exchange involving only 2-cycles and 3-
cycles. We also
present an approximation algorithm and an
exact algorithm
for the problem of finding a maximum weight
exchange
involving cycles of bounded length. The exact
algorithm has
been used to provide optimal solutions to
real kidney
exchange problems arising from the National
Matching Scheme
for Paired Donation run by NHS Blood and
Transplant, and we
describe practical experience based on this
collaboration.},keywords = {Living kidney

  abstract={Most transplanted kidneys are from cadavers, but there are also many transplants from live donors. Recently, there have started to be kidney exchanges involving two donor-patient pairs such that each donor cannot give a kidney to the intended recipient because of immunological incompatibility, but each patient can receive a kidney from the other donor. Exchanges are also made in which a donor-patient pair makes a donation to someone waiting for a cadaver kidney, in return for the patient in the pair receiving high priority for a compatible cadaver kidney when one becomes available. There are stringent legal/ethical constraints on how exchanges can be conducted. We explore how larger scale exchanges of these kinds can be arranged efficiently and incentive compatibly, within existing constraints. The problem resembles some of the â€œhousingâ€ problems studied in the mechanism design literature for indivisible goods, with the novel feature that while live donor kidneys can be assigned simultaneously, cadaver kidneys cannot. In addition to studying the theoretical properties of the proposed kidney exchange, we present simulation results suggesting that the welfare gains from larger scale exchange would be substantial, both in increased number of feasible live donation transplants, and in improved match quality of transplanted kidneys.},

Our main result is that when a specific chain selection rule proposed by Roth et al. is used, these two mechanisms are equivalent. While the equivalence is relevant for one specific case of the \{TTCC\} mechanism, it is a particularly interesting case since it is the only version identified by Roth et al. to be both Pareto-efficient and strategy-proof.
