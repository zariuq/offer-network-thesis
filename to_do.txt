April 10th -- 9 am

  -- Keep to-do list up to date
  -- Literature
    : Web-of-needs, and other related projects
    : Market performance metrics
      : What does ideal performance look like?
  -- Think about graph-based heuristics
    : As you don't need to necessarily find 100% of the matches, 80%'d be fine
  -- Write up specification of offer networks
  -- Determine problem complexity and adaptable algorithms
  -- Look into realistic demographics for ON (offer network) instances
    : perhaps via e-bay developers program API?
    : try white-papers in industry
  -- Write code to generate ON instances (based on parameters)
    : Now with non-random instances!
  -- Adapt library / implement algorithm to match on instances
  -- Set up together as Simulator for experiments
  -- Run trials & measurements
    : Test, test, test!
  -- If time permits, try to extend features.
    : which methods would be easier to port to decentralized systems?


Personal Notes:

First, I'll break the P-time matching! Yargh!
